## Planning Story

 Started off with designing my ERD and figuring what can I continuously add to this program to make it seem more robust. After finding what I need in the MVP, I start test out my API's curl scripts. Making sure they all (get, post, patch, delete) work the way it should in my terminal. After all testing completed, going to try implement front-end.
